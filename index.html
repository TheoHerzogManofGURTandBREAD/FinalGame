   <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
          I am a junior at ESUMS, a magnet school in West Haven CT. 
          I am currently training to win nationals get accepted to the under 
          19 national rowing team this summer, and to get recruited to college. 
          I like spending time with my dog or human friends, sailing, and camping in Maine. 
          I enjoy woodworking with my dad, and 80s rock. I hope that this game is able to help 
          people make sure that they make smart financial decisions, and that it brings them joy.
